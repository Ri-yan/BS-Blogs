      "The study’s authors analyzed a large data set from participants in two population-based studies: the United Kingdom’s UK Biobank and the Netherlands’ Rotterdam Study.The UK Biobank cohort included 502,536 individuals from England, Scotland, and Wales who began participating in the study between April 2006 and December 2010. They were 37 to 73 years old. In 2017, follow-up data on these individuals became available.The Rotterdam Study, which began in 1990, is ongoing, ultimately involving 14,929 individuals. Follow-up data was released in 2015.In the study, researchers observed changes in the levels of inflammation-related biomarkers related to type 2 diabetes.Lead author Dr. Carolina Ochoa-Rosales, a postdoctoral scientist in nutrition and genetic epidemiology at Erasmus University Medical Centre Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, told Medical News Today that “[t]ype 2 diabetes is partly considered an inflammatory disease, and it is accepted that higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory markers in plasma constitute a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.”The study found that drinking coffee boosts levels of the anti-inflammatory adipokine hormone adiponectinTrusted Source, as well as cytokine interleukin-13, or IL-13. At the same time, coffee consumption decreases levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and leptin, which promote inflammation.“CRP is an inflammation marker that reflects intracellular damage,” explained endocrinologist Dr. Ana Maria Kausel, who was not involved in the study.",

      "Diabetes is a major public health problem that is approaching epidemic proportions globally. Worldwide, the prevalence of chronic, noncommunicable diseases is increasing at an alarming rate. About 18 million people die every year from cardiovascular disease, for which diabetes and hypertension are major predisposing factors. Today, more than 1.7 billion adults worldwide are overweight, and 312 million of them are obese. In addition, at least 155 million children worldwide are overweight or obese. A diabetes epidemic is underway. According to an estimate of International Diabetes Federation comparative prevalence of Diabetes during 2007 is 8.0 % and likely to increase to 7.3% by 2025. Number of people with diabetes is 246 million (with 46% of all those affected in the 40–59 age group) and likely to increase to 380 m by 2025. The comparative prevalence of IGT is 7.5% in 2007 and likely to go up to 6.0 by 2025. The number of people with IGT is 308 million in 2007 and likely to be 418 m by 2025. (1) Almost 80% of the total adult diabetics are in developing countries. The regions with the highest rates are the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East, where 9.2 % of the adult population is affected, and North America (8.4%). The highest numbers, however, are found in the Western Pacific, where some 67 million people have Diabetes, followed by Europe with 53 million. India leads the global top ten in terms of the highest number of people with diabetes with a current figure of 40.9 million, followed by China with 39.8 million. Behind them come USA; Russia; Germany; Japan; Pakistan; Brazil; Mexico and Egypt.",

      "Health influencers love to feed their followers snappy-sounding advice and if it has a number in it, even better.Take the frequently dished out guidance to drink eight glasses of water a day, for example. Nobody really knows where this piece of advice originated from but almost every adult has heard it – in one measurement or another.However, it is completely unnecessary to drink that much water every day. Doctors say that if you aren’t feeling thirsty all the time, you’re probably getting enough to drink, and one 2022 study concluded that everyone is different. “One size does not fit all for drinking water guidelines,” it stated, adding that the belief that everyone needs eight glasses a day “is not backed up by objective evidence”.",
